Lorries In SPAAAAACE!

I'm releasing this into the public domain, without warranty of any sort.

If you want to create a variation, or just copy chunks of code, even for
commercial purposes, feel free. I don't recommend that you do so,
because I wrote this code under a strict time limit and I don't expect
it's any good, but I won't stop you. :)

Unity (http://unity3d.com/) may put some of these files under a more
restrictive license, in which case their license stands. I haven't checked
whether or not this is the case.
